Use Case Implementation Priority
================================

Prioritizing system implementation to address the use cases involves several
factors including:

- *Vision of the project*. The system is being designed with some overall goals
  described by the vision of the project proposal.

- *Requirements of the community*. The stakeholders that comprise the user and
  participant community quite likely has some opinion on functionalities of
  the system that are important to them. If these are not properly addressed,
  then the resulting system may appear as a failure to them.

- *Requirements of the sponsor*. The sponsor has laid out goals in the RFP that
  the project is responding to and also in the final agreement for conducting the work.

- *Dependencies between use cases*. Implementation of functionality to address
  some use cases will require implementation of some components not directly
  specific in a use case.

- *Resources available for implementation*. Some use cases may be identified as
  high priority, but would require resources that would prevent implementation
  of a number of other lower priority features.
  


:TODO: Insert an initial prioritization of the use cases.
