Synchronization API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Synchronization API manages :term:`synchronization` of system metadata and
science metadata among CNs.


.. Note:: Since this will be handled out-of-band with respect to the CN APIs
  for V0.3, there are no Synchronization API methods required for V0.3.

.. module:: CN_synchronization
   :synopsis: Manages synchronization of content between Coordinating Nodes.

.. TODO:: flesh these out.
