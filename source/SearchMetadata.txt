Metadata Attributes for Discovery
=================================

This document describes the attributes pulled from :term:`science metadata`
documents that are used to assist discovery (i.e. search) of content in the DataONE system.


Extracted Search Attributes
---------------------------

Data that exists within the DataONE system is always accompanied by science
metadata in one of the supported metadata schemes (e.g. Dublin Core, EML, or
another supported scheme) and expressed in one of the supported formats (e.g.
XML, RDF-XML). The science metadata is also replicated with the data (where
the Member Node (MN) supports the format and scheme) and additional copies are
replicated across the Coordinating Nodes (CNs). The science metadata is
parsed by the CNs to extract information for verification the content meets
minimal metadata content and consistency requirements, and to support search
operations.


Essential Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- PI / Author

  - name authority service is desired for some control over names appearing in metadata

  - but for search, advantages to keep simple text representation

  - goal of gradual increase in specificity


- Keyword (uncontrolled keywords)

- Key concept -key concepts drawn from a set of ontologies

  - term

  - namespace

- Spatial bounding box (largest bounding rectangle)

- Spatial window (series of spatial envelopes representative of the spatial locations of where the data is collected from / relevant to.).

  - Spatial features (points, bounding boxes, polygons)

  - centroid

  - bounding box

  - polygon

  - ( not largest extent )

  - ( need to resolve the semantics of the bounding box search - e.g. if centroids are recorded but fall outside of bounding box search )


- Named places
 
  - term 

  - type 

  - context (Columbus OH, Columbus GA)

  - namespace of gazeteer  


- Temporal window

  - Relative terms (e.g. paleo periods) need to be supported

  - Date ranges

  - Temporal coverage of the data set  (e.g. searches - during, before, after)
  
- Full text search / Text search on abstract


Desirable Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
- Title (2)

- Type of data (format) (2)
  
  - original data

  - summarized versions

  - method used for processing (to generate summary, or original data)

  - Resource type (spatial, models, observations, web service, ...)


- Scientific variables (from a controlled vocabulary) (1)

- Domain of data (physics, environmental, ...) (1)

- Biological taxonomic extents (1)

- Search by publication (1)


Some Others
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Generator of data (instrument, application)

- Related data (data sets, publications)

- Quality / level of curation

- Organizations involved in study

- Size of data (bytes)

- Number / location of replicas 

- Dimensionality of data 

- Units of measure (for sci variables)

- Identifier (GUID)

- Temporal coverage, low priority

  - (publication date )

  - creation date

  - last modified date

- Permissions on objects (e.g. available to read by user)
