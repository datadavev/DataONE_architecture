----

.. function:: getSystemMetadata(token, GUID) -> :class:`Types.SystemMetadata`

   Describes the science metadata or data object identified by the GUID 
   by returing the system metadata object associated with the GUID.

  :param token: authentication token; ignored for V0.3

  :type token: :class:`Types.AuthToken`

  :param GUID: Identifier for the science data or science metedata object of interest.

  :type GUID: :class:`Types.IdentifierType`

  :returns: System metadata object describing the object.

  :rtype: :class:`Types.SystemMetadata`

  :raise: Exceptions.NotAuthorized

  :raises Exceptions.NotFound: There is no data or science metadata identified
    by the given GUID.

  :raises Exceptions.InvalidRequest: The GUID requested identifies a system metadata
    object.

----

.. function:: get (token, GUID) -> bytes

   Retrieves the science metedata or system metadata object identified by the
   given GUID. If the object identified by the GUID is a data object, then an
   error is raised.

  :param token: authentication token; ignored for V0.3

  :type token: :class:`Types.AuthToken`

  :param GUID:
    The identifier for the science metadata or system metadata object to be
    retrieved.

  :type GUID: :class:`Types.IdentifierType`

  :returns:
    For system metadata objects, the system metadata itself is returned. For
    science metadata objects, this will be the exact byte stream of the science
    metadata oject, as is was original ingested.

  :rtype: bytes

  :raise: Exceptions.NotAuthorized

  :raises Exceptions.NotFound: The object specified by GUID does not exist.

  :raises Exceptions.NotFound: The object specified by the GUID is a data
    object and is not present on this (or any) CN. This response could be
    accompanied by the results of a standard resolve() method call to provide
    more information about the object.

----

.. function:: resolve(token, identifier) -> :class:`Types.ObjectLocationList`

   Given an identifier, returns information that a client can use to retrieve
   the identified target object form the DataONE system. The target may reside
   on a MN or a CN. The actual content returned will be specific to the type
   of interface implemented, and is described in detail in the documentation
   for the implementation (e.g. REST implementation might differ from SOAP
   implementation).

    :param token: authentication token; ignored for V0.3

    :type token: :class:`Types.AuthToken`

    :param identifier: Identifier for the object in question

    :returns: A list of nodes known to contain copies of the target object

    :rtype: :class:`Types.ObjectLocationList`

   .. todo::
     It seems that returning just a simple list of URLs for the service
     endpoints of the relevant MNs is not sufficient. Some sort of MN
     identifier also needs to be returned so that the caller can ask further
     information about MN (which would include the endpoint URL for the MN API
     implementation). Is there a use case that involves asking a CN for
     metadata describing a MN?

   :raise: Exceptions.NotAuthorized

   :raises Exceptions.NotFound: There is no data object identified by the
     given GUID.

   :raises Exceptions.InvalidRequest: The GUID requested identifies a science
     metadata object or a system metadata object.


.. function:: create(systemMetadataGUID, systemMetadata,
                     scienceMetadataGUID, scienceMetadata)

   This is a method used internally by the CN, not exposed to MNs or the
   world. Stores the two given objects (systemMetadata, scienceMetadata) in a
   single atomic action. This method is used as part of the synchronization of
   science metadata between a MN and the CN.

   .. TODO:: Should this method be protected by authorization (i.e. include an
     authorization token)?

  :param systemMetadataGUID: the GUID of the system metadata

  :param systemMetadata:
   The system metadata describing the data package (data and science metadata)

  :param scienceMetaDataGUID: the GUID of the science metadata

  :param scienceMetadata: the science metadata portion of the data package

  :returns: ?
  
  .. TODO:: Define what is returned (if anything)

  :raises exceptions.InvalidMetadataType: 
    the science metadata is not of a type supported by the D1 system


.. function:: reserveId(token, scope, format) -> GUID

   Given an optional scope and format, reserves and returns an identifier within 
   that scope and format that is unique and will not be used by any other sessions.
   Future calls to create() and update() that reference this ID must originate from
   the session in which the identifier was reserved, otherwise an error is raised on
   those methods.

    :param token: authentication token; ignored for V0.3

    :type token: :class:`Types.AuthToken`

    :param scope: an optional string to be used to qualify the scope of the 
      identifer namespace, which is applied differently depending on the format 
      requested. If scope is not supplied, a default scope will be used.
   
    :param format: the optional name of the identifier format to be used, drawn from 
      a DataONE-specific vocabulary of identifier format names, including 
      several common syntaxes such as DOI, LSID, UUID, and LSRN, among others. If
      the format is not supplied by the caller, the CN service will use a default 
      identifier format, which may change over time.

    :returns: The GUID that was reserved

    :rtype: GUID

    :raises Exceptions.NotAuthorized: 

    :raises Exceptions.InvalidArgument: The format requested is not a valid
      format accepted by this service
