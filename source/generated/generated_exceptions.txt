     - The provided identifier conflicts with an existing identifier in the DataONE
       system. When serializing, the identifier in conflict should be rendered
       in traceInformation as the value of an identifier key.

     - `401 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.2>`_
     - Indicates that the credentials supplied (to :func:`CN_crud.login` for example)
       are invalid for some reason.

     - `400 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1>`_
     - The parameters provided in the call were invalid. The names and values of
       parameters should included in traceInformation.

     - `400 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1>`_
     - The supplied system metadata is invalid. This could be because some required
       field is not set, the metadata document is malformed, or the value of
       some field is not valid. The content of traceInformation should contain
       additional information about the error encountered (e.g. name of the
       field with bad value, if the document is malformed).
   * - :exc:`InvalidToken`
     - `401 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.2>`_

     - `404 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.5>`_
     - Used to indicate that an object is not present on the node where the exception
       was raised.  The error message should include a reference to the
       :func:`CN_crud.resolve` method URL for the object.
   * - :exc:`NotImplemented`
     - `501 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.2>`_

       are not implemented.
   * - :exc:`ServiceFailure`
     - `500 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.1>`_
     - Some sort of system failure occurred that is preventing the requested operation
       from completing successfully. This error can be raised by any method in
       the DataONE API.
   * - :exc:`UnsupportedMetadataType`
     - `400 <http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.1>`_
