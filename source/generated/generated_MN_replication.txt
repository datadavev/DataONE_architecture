.. function:: listObjects(token,startTime,[endTime],[objectFormat],[replicaStatus],[start],[count]) -> ObjectList

   Retrieve the list of GUIDs for objects owned by the MN that match the calling
   parameters. This method is required to support the process of :term:`Member
   Node synchronization`. At a minimum, this method should be able to return a
   list of objects that match:

   ``startTime <= SystemMetadata.dateSysMetadataModified``

   but is expected to also support date range (by also specifying ``endTime``),
   and should also support slicing of the matching set of records by indicating
   the starting ``index`` of the response (where 0 is the index of the first
   item) and the ``count`` of elements to be returned.

   :param token: The authentication token returned by ``login()``

   :type token: :class:`Types.AuthToken`

   :param startTime: Indicates the earliest time for matching objects

   :type startTime: :class:`Types.DateTime`

   :param endTime: Indicates the end time for matching objects

   :type endTime: :class:`Types.DateTime`

   :param objectFormat: Restrict results to the specified object format.

   :type objectFormat: :class:`Types.ObjectFormatType`

   :param replicaStatus: Indicates if replicated objects should be returned in
     the list (i.e. any entries present in the :attr:`SystemMetadata.replica`).
     If ``0``, then no objects that have been replicated should be returned. If
     ``1``, then any objects can be returned, regardless of replication status.
     The default value is ``1``.



   :type replicaStatus: replicaStatus

   :param start: The zero-based index of the first value, relative to the first
     record of the resultset that matches the parameters.

   :type start: integer

   :param count: The maximum number of entries that should be returned in the
     response. The Member Node may return less entries than specified in this
     value.

   :type count: integer

   :returns: The list of GUIDs that match the query criteria. If none match, an
     empty list is returned.

   :rtype: :class:`Types.ObjectList`

   :raises Exceptions.InvalidRequest:
     :detailCode: 1540

   :raises Exceptions.NotImplemented:
     :detailCode: 1560

     Raised if some functionality requested is not implemented. In the case of
     an optional request parameter not being supported, the errorCode should be
     400. If the requested format (through HTTP Accept headers) is not
     supported, then the standard HTTP 406 error code should be returned.
