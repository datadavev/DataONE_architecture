Data Types in CICore
--------------------

.. module:: Types
   :synopsis: Catalog of data types (structures) used by the DataONE cicore.

.. Note:: Here we use the Sphinx ``class`` directives to identify data
  structures. This is not meant to imply that these structures are implemented
  as classes - it is merely a convenience mechanism for documentation.

.. Note:: Class structures are described using the Google `Protocol Buffer
  Language`_ . This is for convenience only, and the IDL used will probably
  change in the future.

.. class:: DateTime

  A string that completely identifies a specific point in time.

  - Must include date and time
  - If not specified, then the time zone is 0, i.e. GMT

  Valid representations include:
  
  - `HTTP Full Date`_ format
  - `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmm`
  - `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.mmmmmm`
  - `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmmmm+HH:MM`
  - `YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS.mmmmmm+HHMM`


.. _HTTP Full Date: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3.1

----

.. class:: GUID

  An identifier in the DataONE system. This is equivalent to a unicode string
  of printable characters. All representations of GUIDs must be encoded in
  7-bit ASCII or UTF-8.

----


.. class:: AuthToken

  An AuthToken is used to identify a principal and to assert that the identity
  of the principal has been verified by the DataONE authentication infrastructure.

----


.. class:: GuidList

   A list of GUIDs, so a list of unicode strings.

   ::
   
     message GuidList {
       repeated string guid = 1
     }


----

.. class:: ObjectList

  A list of objects. This provides more information than the GuidList by
  combining a GUID with the DescribeResponse.
  
  ::
  
    message ObjectList {
      
      message ObjectInfo {
        required string guid = 1
        required string DescribeResponse info = 2
      }
    
      repeated DescribeResponse describeresponse = 1
    }

----

.. class:: LogRecord

  A single log entry as reported by a Member Node or Coordinating Node through
  the getLogRecords methods.

  :: 

    message LogRecord {
      required string timestamp = 1
    }

----

.. class:: LogRecords

  A list of LogRecord instances.

  ::

    message LogRecords {
      repeated LogRecord entry = 1
    }

----

.. class:: SystemMetadata

  A set of low level information about an object in the DataONE system.
  SystemMetadata is described in :mod:`SystemMetadata`.

----

.. class:: DescribeResponse  

  Provides a hint about the type, size and state of an object.

  ::

    message DescribeResponse {
      required string objectformat = 1
      required uint64 size = 2
      required DateTime last_modified = 3
    }


  .. attribute:: objectformat

     The value of the :attr:`SystemMetadata.ObjectFormat` entry available in
     the :class:`SystemMetadata`.

  .. attribute:: size

     The size in bytes of the object

  .. attribute:: last_modified

     A DateTime value that indicates when the object was last modified. Note
     that all time stamps in DataONE refer to UTC if no time zone information
     is provided with the value. Note that since content in DataONE is
     intended to be static, this value will refer to the time that the object
     was created on the system responding to the request.

----


.. class:: MNCapabilities

  Describes the capabilities of a MemberNode.

----


.. class:: MNHeartbeatResponse

  The response from :func:`MN_health.heartbeat`

----


.. class:: MNStatus

  The response from :func:`MN_health.getStatus`

----


.. class:: PingResponse

  The response from :func:`MN_health.ping`
