Infrastructure Versions
=======================

Outline of functionality to be implemented in versions of the DataONE
cyber-infrastructure. Version numbers are expressed in three parts:
Major.Minor.Revision to reflect official releases of the software, where:

:Major:

  Is a significantly different release from the previous version number, may
  provide significant additional features and may implement functionality that
  is not backwards compatible with prior releases.

:Minor:

  Adds additional features to an existing release and maintains compatibility
  within the current major version.

:Revision:

  Indicates a minor change from the current version, typically used to provide
  bug fix releases. Will not usually add additional functionality.

Three major versions are planned for the first five years of the DataONE
project. These versions refer to the general implementation of the overall
cyber-infrastructure, though for specific components (e.g. the Coordinating
Node software stack or the Investigator Toolkit), it may be more appropriate
for them to evolve their own versions (with some mapping between those and the
general version of DataONE).

**Version 0.x** represents the prototype implementations to be developed prior to
the first public release of the infrastructure. The general progression of
features for this series beyond the initial specifications involves
configuration of test environments and core API implementation libraries that
are then used to add DataONE features and functionality to various existing
data resources and component applications. The end result of the 0.x series
will be three coordinating nodes and at least three member nodes that
implement DataONE functionality to replicate metadata and data, enable search
and discovery, and supports remote administration and monitoring. Another
important output from the prototyping activities will be documentation and
guidelines for further implementation, detailing the results of stress tests
and evaluation of simulated failures such as node failures and connectivity
issues.

**Version 1.x** is the first public release of the DataONE
cyber-infrastructure and will represent a hardened and well-tested system that
can reliably be placed in a core infrastructure role. Additional features will
be added to the infrastructure throughout the 1.x series, with the majority of
focus addressing the remaining performance and reliability questions as well
the science use cases developed by various working groups during the first
year of activity.

**Version 2.x** represents more advanced functionality that builds upon the
capabilities of the version 1.x series. Anticipated features of the 2.x series
include content validation and quality control services (extending basic
services implemented previously), more sophisticated event and notification
facilities, support for content version migration strategies, and several
service enhancements such as various data extraction, analysis, visualization
and integration operations. An important aspect of the 2.x series development
activities will be ensuring the system being implemented supports as far as
possible the requirements of the scientific use cases identified throughout
project.

   ======== ======== ===============================================================


Detail for Version 0.3
----------------------

Major goals for this target are functional prototype implementations of the
CN, MN and a simple client suitable for testing interactions.

This version of the software represents the initial implementation of the CN
and MN services, and should support at least use cases :doc:`UseCases/01_uc`
and :doc:`UseCases/36_uc`.

The MN implementation will be a Django application that can stand alone, or
interact with Metacat, Dryad, or ORNL DAAC for retrieving data and science
metadata objects. The MN will implement the APIs described in
:doc:`MN_APIs_v0_3` using a REST interface approach as described in
:doc:`REST_interface`. The MN should be able to operate on any Linux, OS X or
Windows platform that supports python 2.6. External dependencies beyond the
standard python install should be clearly documented.

The CN implementation will be a combination of Java servlet applications
including Metacat for object storage, Mercury for object indexing for basic
search and browse, and "cn_service" which will implement the necessary CN APIs
and the logic to interact with the object store and search index. The CN
should implement the APIs described in :doc:`CN_APIs_v0_3` using a REST
interface approach as described in :doc:`REST_interface`. 

The simple client will be implemented in Python and should support the
external APIs provided by both the CN and MN implementations. The client will
be developed primarily to support test operations against the CN and MN,
though should be developed with consideration as a general DataONE client
tool.


Detail for Version 0.4
----------------------

The major change for this target is replication of content across CNs.

Version 0.4 will extend the implementations developed in version 0.3 by adding
support for use cases :doc:`UseCases/02_uc`, :doc:`UseCases/03_uc`,
:doc:`UseCases/06_uc`, and :doc:`UseCases/10_uc`.

This MN implementation for this release should support basic interaction with
at least one of the specified MN targets (i.e. Metacat, Dryad, ORNL DAAC) and
provide access to real data from that service.

The CN implementation will need to support replication between CN (Metacat)
instances.


Detail for Version 0.5
----------------------

The major change for this target is CN driven data replication across MNs.

Version 0.5 will extend the implementation developed in version 0.4 by adding
support for the use cases :doc:`UseCases/06_uc`, :doc:`UseCases/16_uc`, and
:doc:`UseCases/17_uc`.

At completion of this milestone, the infrastructure will support the basic
functionality of DataONE except with no integration of identity,
authentication, and minimal authorization (dictated by machine connections
rather than user identities).
