Exceptions Raised by MN and CN APIs
-----------------------------------

All exceptions raised by APIS methods in DataONE cicore should include three
basic elements of information:

============ ===============================================================
Element      Description
============ ===============================================================
code         The error code.  This is the HTTP error code (i.e. 4xx)
error_detail A more detailed error code which provides a precise indication 
             of where the exception was raised.
description  A human readable message describing what happened
============ ===============================================================

There will be conditions encountered where exceptions are raised in the APIs
which are not exposed to HTTP.  In these cases, the ``error_detail`` and 
``description`` values must be included.

TODO:: Define what code should be used in place of the HTTP error code.


Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: Exceptions
   :synopsis: Exceptions that are raised by MN, CN, and ITK software.

.. exception:: InvalidCredentials

.. exception:: AuthenticationTimeout

.. exception:: InvalidToken

.. exception:: NotFound

.. exception:: NotAuthorized

.. exception:: UnsupportedType

.. exception:: InsufficientResources

.. exception:: IdentifierNotUnique

.. exception:: InvalidRequest

   The parameters provided in the call were invalid.


.. exception:: IdentityAlreadyExists

   The requested identifier already exists in the DataONE system so can not be
   reserved as a new identifier.


.. exception:: InvalidMetadataType


.. exception:: ObjectNotHere



HTTP Exception Handling Codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following HTTP codes are used in HTTP response header when an exception
needs to be raised from one of the MemberNodes. The current exceptions from
Member Node operations that need to be mapped to these codes are:

:MN_authorization: InvalidCredentials, AuthenticationTimeout, InvalidToken

:MN_crud: NotFound, NotAuthorized, UnsupportedType, InsufficientResources, 
  IdentifierNotUnique, UnsupportedType

:MN_replication: InvalidCriteria, InvalidIdentifier, InvalidOperation

Here are candidate HTTP error codes, that need to be mapped to these
exceptions.

==== =================== =======================================================
Code Meaning             Description
==== =================== =======================================================
400  Bad Request         Bad request if the request REST operation is invalid,
                         serialization is erroneous, mime type is not supported, 
                         or resource is not supported.
401  Unauthorized        Authentication failure. Credentials are required or 
                         were invalid. Corresponds to InvalidCredentials.
403  Forbidden           The current user does not have the right to perform 
                         the requested action.
404  Not Found           The object does not exist.
405  Method not allowed  The HTTP method used is not allowed on this resource.
                         Response must include an Allow header indicating valid
                         HTTP methods.
406  Not Acceptable      The resource identified by the request is only capable 
                         of generating response entities which have content 
                         characteristics not acceptable according to the accept 
                         headers sent in the request.
408  Request Timeout     The client did not produce a request within the time 
                         that the server was prepared to wait.
409  Conflict            The request could not be completed due to a conflict 
                         with the current state of the resource.
410  Gone                The resource is known to be permanently deleted (as 
                         opposed to 404 which indicates uncertainty about the
                         state of the object).   
413  Request Entity Too  The server is refusing to process a request because 
     Large               the request entity is larger than the server is willing 
                         or able to process.
415  Unsupported Media   The server is refusing to service the request because 
     Type                the entity of the request is in a format not supported 
                         by the requested resource for the requested method. 
==== =================== =======================================================

.. Note:: We still need to define error message formats (e.g., XML) for the 
   content of the returned error documents.

The body of the corresponding error messages should be encoded according to
the format indicted by the Accept content type header of the request. This
should default to a format that is easily readable by a web browser (e.g.
xhtml).

====================== ===== ==================================================
Exception              Code  Description
====================== ===== ==================================================
InvalidCredentials     401   The supplied credentials could not be verified
AuthenticationTimeout  408   The client took too long to complete the request
InvalidToken           401   The supplied authentication token is not valid
NotFound               404   The referenced object could not be located
NotAuthorized          401   Access to the indicated resource is not permitted 
                             with the supplied credentials
UnsupportedType        400   Treated as an invalid request.  Response should 
                             indicate the problem with the supplied data.
InsufficientResources  413   This could be 400, 413, or 415, though none of 
                             these correspond with the semantics of the error 
                             condition.
IdentifierNotUnique    409   The supplied identifier already exists so conflicts 
                             with the state of the resource
UnsupportedType        406   This could be 400 or 406
InvalidCriteria        400   The request is by definition, malformed, hence 400
InvalidIdentifier      404   The indicated resource doesn't exist
InvalidOperation       409   Not sure if this exception is even necessary, but 
                             technically this is a state of conflict with the
                             resource.
====================== ===== ==================================================

Response body should contain:

- Include http code in body + header
- Detailed code that breaks down more specifically (e.g. 401 + detail)
- Human readable string
