Notes
~~~~~

- Users can be members of groups that can participate in access directives.

- I have removed the phrase "and replication" from the use case statement
  because use case #8 deals with setting replication policies. (PEA)

- Step #1, should have a signature of setAccess(token, GUID, accessPolicy).
  Even though the diagram says "Assume user authority for specifying
  restrictions", practically speaking we will need to verify that authority
  and the user's identify with a token. Also "accessLevel" sounds very
  limited, and access policy implies a possibly more sophisticated access
  policy delineation, including embargoes.
