Goal
  Communicate the locations where a data object can be found

Summary 

  Within DataONE, a registered data object may be held on 
  one or more Member Nodes (depending on replication policy). 
  Clients must be able to ask a Coordinating Node for those locations.
  
  Ideally, the response to this query is a list of member node 
  identifiers and the URL endpoint of their DataONE API implementation.

Actors
  - Coordinating Node
  - Client requesting info

Preconditions 
  - Coordinating Nodes are operational
  
Triggers
  - Request by client
 
Post Conditions
  - Client has more information about the Member Node
