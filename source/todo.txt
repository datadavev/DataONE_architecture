TO DO List
==========

List of things that need to be completed in these documents to reach a final
draft stage.

The schema for ObjectLocationList? is specified here:

     http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs/Types.html#Types.ObjectLocationList

This schema is confusing and imprecise and needs to be clarified. The schema
is particularly unclear about the 'node' field, which it defines as:

node

A node identifier. Currently, this should be the node name + base path. For
example, a Member Node with domain name “mn1.dataone.org” that serves content
from /mn would be identified as mn1.dataone.org/mn

This definition conflates three different fields as if they were one
(identifier, baseUrl, and name). These three separate concepts are used in the
node registry definitions, and should be reused here. This use of the term
node should be changed to match the semantics of the 'baseUrl' field in the
node registry. We can also consider adding in an 'identifier' field to provide
the node identifier. The Node name may also be useful for clients that want to
present a choice of download locations that is more human readable . So I
suggest the following new data structures for ObjectLocationList? and
ObjectLocation?:

message ObjectLocationList? {

    required IdentifierType? identifier = 1;
    repeated ObjectLocation? locations = 2;

}

message ObjectLocation? {

    required string name = 1;
    required NodeReference? identifier = 2;
    required string baseUrl = 3;
    required string url = 4;

}

If these design changes are made, then the java and python client stacks and
all MN and CN implementations of resolve() would need to be modified suitably,
so separate tasks would need to be entered for those component changes.
