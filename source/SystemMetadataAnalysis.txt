Introduction
------------

The DataONE systems metadata is critical to ensuring that scientific 
data, scientific metadata, and other digital objects stored in DataONE 
are discoverable, accessible, auditable, verifiable, and are associated 
with meaningful related digital objects. Digital objects in DataONE must 
also be viable for the long term &ndash; for many decades &ndash; and so 
the system metadata must also include provenance information. 

Due primarily to the project deliverable schedule, the current DataONE 
system metadata definition (reference) is focused on the essential 
metadata values that must be available to support the earliest versions 
of DataONE. So far, relatively little attention has been paid to 
ensuring that system metadata contains appropriate attributes for the 
long haul. 

This document describes some of the results of a practicum project 
carried out by Elizabeth (Betsy) Allen in Spring 2010. The PREMIS Data 
Dictionary for Preservation Metadata (PREMIS Editorial Committee, 2008) 
was used as a standard against which the explicit and implicit 
requirements of DataONE would be measured. This project also took the 
Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) 
(reference) and the BagIt File Packaging Format (reference) into account 
as possible standards for aggregations, or packages, of Web resources. 

The document is organized as follows. A set of high-level requirements 
was developed to represent the general needs of the DataONE system 
metadata. For each of the high-level requirements identified, the 
relevant sections of the PREMIS data dictionary were identified, and 
missing, additional, mismatched aspects are identified in the text. The 
documentation for BagIt and OAI-ORE were consulted and their relevance 
to the requirement is also discussed in the text. Optionally, use cases 
relevant to the requirement are described, using scientific data 
specified in EML, Dryad, ORNL DAAC, and/or NBII formats as examples. The 
section on each requirement ends with a general discussion of the 
overall analysis. 


System Metadata Requirements
----------------------------

For each of the high-level requirements identified, the relevant 
sections of the PREMIS data dictionary were identified, and missing, 
additional, mismatched aspects are identified in the text. The 
documentation for BagIt and OAI-ORE were consulted and their relevance 
to the requirement is also discussed in the text. Optionally, use cases 
relevant to the requirement are described, using scientific data

section on each requirement ends with a general discussion of the 
overall analysis. 


Requirement 1: Perform replication on digital objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

To increase accessibility and help ensure long-term preservation, the 
Coordinating Nodes will perform replications on digital objects. Systems 
metadata will be replicated at each of the three Coordinating Nodes, 
while datasets and their associated descriptive metadata will be 
replicated at a minimum of two Member Nodes. 

What PREMIS suggests
....................

When a replication is performed, the DataONE system will need to record 
which object was replicated (1.1), the unique identifier of the new copy 
(1.1), where the replicate is stored in the system (1.7), information on 
the derivative relationship between the original object and the new one 
(1.10), and information on the event that created the replicate such as 
the unique identifier of the event (2.1), type = replication (2.2), time 
(2.3), who performed the replication (2.6), and a link between the 
replicated object and the event (2.7).

Requirement 2: Perform preservation migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........

Migration is one kind of preservation strategy that Coordinating Nodes 
may choose to use when a particular format of an object is in danger of 
obsolescence. Also, through time, the physical media the digital objects 
are stored on will degrade and an object will need to be migrated to a 
new media. 

What PREMIS suggests
....................

Prior to migrating an object to a different format the system must first 
know the following information: current format name and version 
(1.5.4.1.1 and 1.5.4.1.2, respectively), assurance that the file to be 
migrated is not corrupted (1.5.2 fixity), which alternative format is 
the best possible format to migrate the file to given the hardware and 
software requirements (refer to a digital format registry?), and name 
and version of application that created the object (1.5.5.1 and 1.5.5.2, 
respectively). 

When performing a migration due to format obsolescence, the DataONE 
system will need to record the following metadata: which object is being 
replicated (1.1), what is the unique identifier of the new object (1.1), 
where in the system is the new object stored (1.7), information on the 
derivative relationship between the original object and the new one 
(1.10). Also, it needs to record metadata on the event that created the 
newly migrated object such as unique identifier (2.1), type = migration 
(2.2), time (2.3), who performed the migration (2.6), and a link between 
the migrated object and the event (2.7). 

When migration for physical media obsolescence occurs, the system should 
record where the object is now located (1.7.1 contentLocation).

Requirement 3: Record specific types of relationships between objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS suggest the system record as semantic units to define structural, 
derivative and dependency relationships. For structural relationships, 
characterizations of these relationship types are recorded with a 
description of the relationship type, such as "structural" (1.10.1), 
relationship sub-type such as "is a part of" (1.10.2), and the unique 
identifier of the related object (1.10.3). 

In addition to the above units the system needs to record for strucutral 
relationships, it also needs to record additional information for 
derivative relationships. Because this type of relationship involves an 
event, the system must record the unique event identifier (1.10.4). 

Dependency relationships, such as a data type definition needed to 
render another file or modules needed by a software program that is 
required to render an object, are characterized in 1.8.4 "dependency" 
and 1.8.5.5 "swDependency" respectively.

Requirement 5: Support digital object re-use 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

Relationships , entities , citation, life science identifiers [exchange 
of digital objects between repositories? METS?] 
 

What PREMIS suggests
....................

Potential users of digital objects need to know of any structural, 
derivative, and dependency relationships properties in order to re-use 
an object. For example, databases are often stored in repsotiories as 
two files: one for content and oen for the schema. The user needs to 
access both files to re-use the databse. The suggested PREMIS semantic 
units for relationships are described under general requirement 3. 
Citation and persistent identifiers, such as LSIDs, are not addressed in 
PREMIS.

Requirement 6: Record software and hardware specifications for future object rendering 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

Emulation is a core preservation strategy for digital objects. 

What PREMIS suggests
....................

To emulate a digital object whose format is obsolete, the DataONE system 
must record information that characterizes both the software (1.8.5) and 
hardware (1.8.6) environent for each object. PREMIS requires 
software/hardware name and type to be recorded, while software version 
(1.8.5.2), software components needed by the software (1.8.5.5), and 
other information are optional.

Requirement 7: Record provenance information (e.g., prinicpal, timestamp, event, rights) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........

Recording provenance allows users of digital objects to follow who has 
created and acted upon the object, when they did so, [and what possible 
actions on this object are permissible? (can you explain how rights are 
involved in provenance? perhaps rights should be its own requirement?)] 


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS states that provenance is one of the many attributes necessary 
for a digital object to be authentic (pg. 200); however, because 
demonstrating provenance involves many semantic units, it deserves to be 
its own requirement rather than a sub-requirement for authenticity [bad 
justification?]. The DataONE systems would capture provenance by 
recording who is doing what to the digital object through time. This 
includes recording information on the unique object identifier (1.1), 
the original name of the object if it was not created within the 
repository (1.6), and any relationships this item has with other digital 
objects such as "is a source of" (1.10). The majority of semantic units 
necessary to record provenance come from the event entity. The system 
will need to create a unique identifier for each event (2.1), describe 
the event type taken from a controlled vocabulary, (e.g. migration and 
ingestion)(2.1), and record when the event occurred (2.3). Optionally, 
ir could store details about the event, which are non-machine readable 
(2.4), and any information on the success of the event (2.5).

Requirement 8: Record information to ensure viability of preserved objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS defines viability as the "property of being readable from media". 
The PREMIS working group intentionally avoided defining detailed 
semanitc units for viability with the exception of 1.7.2, storage media, 
where the medium for storing an object is defined. More detailed 
information on media would likely be desirable so that repository 
managers would know when to refresh the medium.

Requirement 9: Record information to ensure authenticity of preserved objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

Authenticity is the "quality of being what it purports to be". This 
includes the conepts of fixity, integrity, and the use of digital 
signatures.  


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS has many semantic units that can be used as evidence of an 
object's authenticity (1.5 and its sub-units). It is mandatory to record 
either format designation of the object from a controlled vocabulary 
(e.g. base64 or Adobe PDF)(1.5.4) or identify the format type through 
reference to a format registry (1.5.4.2). It is recommended, though 
optional, that the DataONE system record the message digest (1.5.2.2), 
the specific algorithm used to create the message digest (1.5.2.1), and 
who created the original digest (1.5.2.3). 

Digital signature information is an optional unit in PREMIS (1.9). ["A 
repository may have a policy of generating digital signatures for files 
on ingest, or may have a need to store and later validate incoming 
digital signatures". Which is it for DataONE or is it both?] To use 
digital signatures the system need to record the signature value 
(1.9.1.4), the "designation for the encryption and hash algorithms used 
for signature generation" (1.9.1.3), the rules for validating the 
signature (1.9.1.5), the encoding used for the singature (1.9.1.1), the 
signer's public key (1.9.1.7) and who created the signature (1.9.1.2 or 
3.1). [Should recording the object's size be a requirement for 
authenticity? It is a characteristic, but I think it is more important 
for ensuring that a replication was successful] 

The semantic unit 1.5 is used to record object characteristics, but 
demonstrating that the object characteristics are in fact valid occurs 
through events. For example, performing regular fixity checks is 
captured through the units event identifier (2.1), event type such as 
"fixity check" (2.2), and event date (2.3). Digital signature validation 
and format validation are also types of events that need to be recorded 
to show authenticity (2.3).

Requirement 10: Ensure that principals are authenticated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........

Software, organization. public key, 


What PREMIS suggests
....................

Principals are called agents in PREMIS. They are associated with either 
events that occur to a digital object or the rights associated with an 
object, but they are never directly linked to an object. PREMIS only has 
one required semantic unit for principal, which is agentIdentifier 
(3.1). Other optional units used to describe an agent include name (3.2) 
and type such as organization, software or person (3.3). The PREMIS Data 
Dictionary suggests that systems use digital signatures for 
authenticating submitters to and distributors from the system; however, 
because validation takes place right after signing, there is no need for 
the respository to preserve the signature itself through time. The 
system can record the act of validation as an Event if desired.
