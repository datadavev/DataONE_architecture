Introduction
------------

The DataONE systems metadata is critical to ensuring that scientific data,
scientific metadata, and other digital objects stored in DataONE are
discoverable, accessible, auditable, verifiable, and are associated with
meaningful related digital objects. Digital objects in DataONE must also be
viable for the long term &ndash; for many decades &ndash; and so the system
metadata must also include provenance information.

Due primarily to the project deliverable schedule, the current DataONE system
metadata definition (reference) is focused on the essential metadata values
that must be available to support the earliest versions of DataONE. So far,
relatively little attention has been paid to ensuring that system metadata
contains appropriate attributes for the long haul.

This document describes some of the results of a practicum project carried out
by Elizabeth (Betsy) Allen in Spring 2010. The PREMIS Data Dictionary for
Preservation Metadata (reference) was used as a standard against which the
explicit and implicit requirements of DataONE would be measured. This project
also took the Open Archives Initiative's Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE)
(reference) and the BagIt File Packaging Format (reference) into account as
possible standards for aggregations, or packages, of Web resources.

The document is organized as follows. A set of high-level requirements was
developed to represent the general needs of the DataONE system metadata. For
each of the high-level requirements identified, the relevant sections of the
PREMIS data dictionary were identified, and missing, additional, mismatched
aspects are identified in the text. The documentation for BagIt and OAI-ORE
were consulted and their relevance to the requirement is also discussed in the
text. Optionally, use cases relevant to the requirement are described, using
scientific data specified in EML, Dryad, ORNL DAAC, and/or NBII formats as
examples. The section on each requirement ends with a general discussion of
the overall analysis.


System Metadata Requirements
----------------------------

For each of the high-level requirements identified, the relevant sections of
the PREMIS data dictionary were identified, and missing, additional,
mismatched aspects are identified in the text. The documentation for BagIt and
OAI-ORE were consulted and their relevance to the requirement is also

Requirement 1: Perform replication on digital objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

To increase accessibility and help ensure long-term preservation, the
Coordinating Nodes will perform replications on digital objects. Systems
metadata will be replicated at each of the three Coordinating Nodes, while
data sets and their associated descriptive metadata will be replicated at a
minium of two member nodes.


What PREMIS suggests
....................

When a replication is performed, the Coordinating Node will need to record
which object was replicated (1.1), unique identifier of the new copy (1.1),
where the replicate is stored (1.7), information on the derivative
relationship between the original object and the new one (1.10), and
information on the event that created the replicate such as unique identifier
(2.1), type = replication (2.2), time (2.3), who performed the replication
(2.6), and a link between the replicated object and the event (2.7).

Requirement 2: Perform preservation migration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........

Migration could be performed when the physical 
media an object is stored on or particular format of an object is in 
danger of obsolescence. 


What PREMIS suggests
....................

When migration for physical media obsolescence occurs, the Coordinating Node
needs to know where the object is located (1.7.1 contentLocation). In order to
migrate an object to a different format the following information should be
known: current format name and version (1.5.4.1.1 and 1.5.4.1.2,
respectively), assurance that the file to be migrated is not corrupted (1.5.2
fixity), which alternative format is the best possible format to migrate the
file to given hardware and software requirements (refer to a digital format
registry?), and name and version of application that created object (1.5.5.1
and 1.5.5.2, respectively). Metadata the Coordinating Node will need to record
include which object was replicated (1.1), unique identifier of the new copy
(1.1), where the new object is stored (1.7), information on the derivative
relationship between the original object and the new one (1.10). Also, they
need to record metadata on the event that created the new migrated object such
as unique identifier (2.1), type = migration (2.2), time (2.3), who performed
the migration (2.6), and a link between the migrated object and the event
(2.7).

Requirement 3: Record specific types of relationships between objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS has semantic units to define structural, derivative and dependency
relationships. For structural and derivative relationships, characterizations
of the relationship types (1.10) Related objects are linked through their
unique object identifier (1.1). Because derivative objects are created by an
event, this relationship is further described using the semantic unit 1.10.4
Dependency relationships, such as a data type definition needed to render
another file or modules needed by a software program that is required to
render an object, are characterized in 1.8.4 "dependency" and 1.8.5.5
"swDependency" respectively.

Requirement 6: Record software and hardware specifications for future object rendering 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

Emulation is a core preservation strategy for 
digital objects. 

What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS has semantic units to characterize both the software (1.8.5) and
hardware (1.8.6) environent for each object. Software/hardware name and type
are required units, while software version (1.8.5.2), software components
needed by the software (1.8.5.5), and other information are optional.

Requirement 7: Record provenance information (e.g., prinicpal, timestamp, event, rights) 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........

Recording provenance allows users of digital objects to follow who has created
and acted upon the object, when they did so, and what possible actions on this
object are permissible [can you explain how rights are involved in provenance?
perhaps rights should be its own requirement?]


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS states that provenance is one of the many attributes necessary for a
digital object to be authentic (pg. 200); however, because demonstrating
provenance involves many semantic units, it deserves to be its own requirement
rather than a sub-requirement for authenticity [bad justification?].
Provenance is captured by recording who is doing what to the digital object
through time. This includes recording information on the unique object
identifier (1.1), the original name of the object if it was not created within
the repository (1.6), and any relationships this item has with other digital
objects such as "is a source of". The majority of semantic units necessary to
record provenance come from the event entity. The coordinating nodes will need
to create a unique identifier for each event (2.1), describe the event type
taken from a controlled vocabulary, (e.g. migration and ingestion)(2.1), and
when the event occurred (2.3). Optionally, they could store details about the
event, which are non-machine readable (2.4), and any information on the
success of the event (2.5).

Requirement 8: Record information to ensure viability of preserved objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........


What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS defines viability as the "property of being readable from media". The
PREMIS working group intentionally avoided defining detailed semanitc units
for viability with the exception of 1.7.2, storage media, where the medium for
storing an object is defined. More detailed information on media would likely
be desirable so that repository managers would know when to refresh the
medium.

Requirement 9: Record information to ensure authenticity of preserved objects 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description
...........

Authenticity is the "quality of being what it purports to be" This includes
the conepts of fixity, integrity, and the use of digital signatures.

What PREMIS suggests
....................

PREMIS has many semantic units (1.5 and its sub-units) that can be used as
evidence of an object's authenticity. It is recommended, though optional, that
the Coordinating Nodes record the message digest (1.5.2.2), the specific
algorithm used to create the message digest (1.5.2.1), and who created the
original digest (1.5.2.3). Also, it is mandatory to record either format
designation of the object from a controlled vocabulary (e.g. base64 or Adobe
PDF)(1.5.4) or identifies the format type through reference to a format
registry (1.5.4.2). Digital signature information is an optional unit in
PREMIS (1.9). ["A repository may have a policy of generating digital
signatures for files on ingest, or may have a need to store and later validate
incoming digital signatures" which is it for DataONE or is it both?] To use
digital signatures the Coordinating Nodes need to record the signature value
(1.9.1.4), "designation for the encryption and hash algorithms used for
signature generation" (1.9.1.3), the rules for validating the signature
(1.9.1.5), encoding used for the singature (1.9.1.1), signer's public key
(1.9.1.7) and who created the signature (1.9.1.2 or 3.1). [Should recording
the object's size be a requirement for authenticity? It is a characteristic,
but I think it is more important for ensuring that a replication was
successful]

The semantic unit 1.5 is used to record object characteristics, but 
demonstrating that the object characteristics are in fact valid occurs 
through events. For example, performing regular fixity checks is 
captured through the units event identifier (2.1), event type such as 
"fixity check" (2.2), and event date (2.3). Digital signature validation 
and format validation are also type of events that need to be recorded 
to show authenticity (2.3).

Requirement 10: Ensure that principals are authenticated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Description
...........

Software, organization. public key, 


What PREMIS suggests
....................

Principals are called agents in PREMIS. They are associated with either events
that occur to a digital object or the rights associated with an object, but
they are never directly linked to an object. PREMIS only has one required
semantic unit for principal, which is agentIdentifier (3.1). Other optional
units used to describe an agent include name (3.2) and type such as
organization, software or person (3.3). The PREMIS Data Dictionary suggests
that repositories use digital signatures for authenticating submitters to and
distributors from the repository; however, because validation takes place
right after signing, there is no need for the respository to preserve the
signature itself through time. The Coordinating Nodes can record the act of
validation as an Event if desired.
