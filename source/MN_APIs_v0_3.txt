Member Node APIs for V0.3
-------------------------


These APIs are implemented by Member Nodes for version 0.3. This is a reduced set of functionality compared to the full set of APIs envisioned for Member Nodes.

.. todo:: 
   The APIs need to be edited for consistency of method signatures and naming.
   Update the sequence diagrams to reflect the edits to the API.


Authorization API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no authorization API for this version. All authorization and authentication will be handled by network configuration, out-of-band with respect to the MN APIs.


CRUD API
~~~~~~~~

.. module:: MN_crud_0_3
   :synopsis: Read operations on member nodes.

::

  getSystemMetadata(token, GUID) -> objectMetadata
  get(token, GUID) -> object
  getLogRecords(token, fromDate, toDate)
  log (create, creationDate, ID)
  listChangedRecords(token, query)
  

.. exception:: NotFound

.. exception:: NotAuthorized

.. exception:: UnsupportedType

.. exception:: InsufficientResources


.. function:: getSystemMetadata(token, GUID) -> objectMetadata

   Describes the object located at the endpoint of a GUID. This is necessary
   to enable a client (e.g. a CN doing synchronization of new content) to
   determine what type of information is being referenced before it is
   registered in the system metadata. Helps to avoid accidental download of
   data objects rather than metadata.

   :param token: Identity with privileges to read the GUID.

   :param GUID: Identifier for the object in question.

   :rtype: Metadata describing the object to which the GUID refers .


.. function:: get(token, GUID) -> object

   Retrieve an object identified by GUID from the Member Node.

   :param token: The authentication token returned by ``login()``

   :param GUID: The identifier for the object to be retrieved.

   :rtype: 
    Bytes of the specified object. For data objects, this will be the actual
    bytes of data. For metadata objects, this will be the representation of
    the object as provided by the Member Node.

   :raises NotAuthorized: The supplied identity does not have READ permission on the object.

   :raises NotFound: The object specified by GUID does not exist.

   .. Note:: There may be multiple representations of content (e.g. metadata as
      XML, RDF, or some other format).  May need to add another parameter to specify
      the format, or perhaps rely on HTTP content negotiation for this.



.. function:: getLogRecords(token, fromDate, toDate)

  Retrieve log information from the MN for the specified date range (inclusive).



.. function:: log (create, creationDate, ID)


Replication API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Replication API handles CN-directed replication of content between MNs and also supports the initial harvesting of science metadata from a MN by a CN. Method names used for the former include some form of "replication" in their name. Method names used for the latter include some form of "synchronize" in their name.
 
Note that MN-to-MN science metadata and data replication in V0.3 is handled out-of-band with respect to this API so explicit API methods to support that are not included here in V0.3.

.. module:: MN_replication_0_3
   :synopsis: Handles CN-directed replication of content between member nodes; also supports the initial harvesting of science metadata from a MN by a CN.

::
  listObjects(token query) -> GUIDs
  synchronizationComete(token, GUID)

.. exception:: InvalidCriteria

.. exception:: InvalidIdentifier

.. exception:: InvalidOperation

.. function::  listObjects (token, query) -> GUIDs

   Retrieve the list of GUIDs for objects owned by the MN that meet the query criteria. This method supports the synchronization of science metadata from a MN to a CN. The query specification must be rich enough

   :param token: The authentication token; ignored for V0.3

   :param query: The criteria specifying the characteristics of the objects of interest. The structure of this query is not yet defined. It must be rich enough  so that a CN can ask "What science metadata objects do you own, that are not yet synchronized to a CN?" There are likely other queries that will need to be posed as well.

   :returns: The list of GUIDs that match the query criteria. If none match, an empty list is returned.
   
   :raises InvalidCriteria: The MN cannot understand or parse the query criteria.



.. function::  synchronizationComplete (token, GUID)
   
   This is a callback method used by a CN to indicate to a MN that it has completed replication of the science metadata identified by GUID. When called, the MN should somehow record that syncrhonization is complete for that object so that the next time it reponds to a ``listObjects(token, query)`` query the object will not be included as requiring synchronization.
   
   :param token: The authentication token; ignored for V0.3
   
   :param GUID: The GUID of the science metadata object that is now synchronized with the CN. 

   :returns: A simple ACK.
   
   :raises InvalidIdentifier: The supplied GUID does not identify a science metadata object owned by the MN. 
   
   :raises InvalidOperation: The science metadata object identified by the GUID is already marked as synchronized.


Capabilities API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is no Capabilities API for this version.



State of Health API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reports on the status of a Member Node.

.. module:: MN_health_0_3
   :synopsis: Reports on the status of a Member Node.
   
::

  heartbeat() -> response

.. function:: heartbeat() -> response
   
   Low level "Are you alive?" operation.  The member node should perform some minimal internal functionality testing before answering. However, heartbeat checks will be frequent (every few minutes) so the internal functionality test should not be high impact.

   :returns: A simple chunk of data, perhaps XML, or plain text. Response is a simple ACK, including the version number of the MN API supported by the MN, an indication if it considers itself fully functional or not, and a timestamp from the MN when the response was produced.  

   .. Note:: This method will be used by Use Case 10 "MN Status Reports" for V0.3, but that use case will require the use of ``getStatus(token)`` from this same API for later versions.
