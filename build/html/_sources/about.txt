About These Documents
=====================

These documents are generated using the excellent open source tools Sphinx_
for the overall document processing and generation, and PlantUML_ for the
various UML diagrams.

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

Sphinx_ and PlantUML_ are required to build the design documents from the source.

Sphinx can be installed on any system with Python using setuptools_ ::

  sudo easy_install -U Sphinx

Installing PlantUML is simply a matter of downloading the plantuml.jar file
from the PlantUML_ site and putting it somewhere it can be executed. The
script I use for running PlantUML is::

  #!/bin/sh
  CONFIG=/Users/vieglais/Projects/DataONE/svn/software/tools/trunk/docutils/plantuml.conf
  java -jar ~/bin/plantuml.jar -config $CONFIG $1 $2 $3 $4 $5

The plantuml.conf file is in the DataONE subversion source tree.

To actually build a HTML copy of the documents::

  $ cd ~/Projects/DataONE/svn/documents/Projects/Infrastructure/Design
  $ plantuml
  $ <quit>
  $ cd UseCases
  $ plantuml
  $ <quit>
  $ cd ..
  $ make html

Note that plantuml currently (20091110) has a bug that prevents integration
with the Makefile. The author has been contacted an a solution is in the works
(he has been very responsive to suggestions so far).
