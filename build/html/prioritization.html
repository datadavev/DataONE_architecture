<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The DataONE Core Cyberinfrastructure Team / Virtual Data Center Technical
Working Group (CCIT/VDC TWG, hereafter CCIT) was charged with developing a
prioritization of the approximately three dozen use cases developed to date.
The prioritization was to be shared with the DataONE Leadership Team in order
to come to agreement for the development priorities for years 1 through 5.
This agreement was considered an important deliverable for the DataONE kickoff
meeting in October 2009.</p>
<p>The CCIT reviewed existing documents, including the CI Preliminary Task List,
the Service Interface Prioritization diagram, the DataONE – VDC June 2009
Technical Working Group Meeting Report, and the DataNetONE Implementation Plan
(primarily Objective 4) – see References, below. The use cases are defined in
the DataONE Architecture document available at
<a class="reference external" href="https://repository.dataone.org/documents/Projects/VDC/docs/service-api/api-documentation/Architecture.html">https://repository.dataone.org/documents/Projects/VDC/docs/service-api/api-documentation/Architecture.html</a>.
Goals and milestones expressed in the CI Preliminary Task List were
foundational for developing the proposed prioritization (see Table 1).</p>
<p>In some instances, use case implementations in the early years may be partial
or limited implementations with work continuing in later years until
completion. Examples of use cases that are likely to be improved over time are
authentication, logging, search and retrieval, event notifications, etc. Work
on other goals and milestones will begin as early as year 1, led by the
appropriate working group, with the initial implementation in a subsequent
year (e.g., scientific use cases; workflow support; ontology support). Certain
goals and milestones (e.g., replication of data and metadata) will be met by
evaluating alternatives and selecting a set of existing software applications.
Additional details about Member Nodes will be provided in a separate document,
forthcoming. This prioritization is mapped optimistically to the 5-year
schedule: goals, milestones, and specific use cases that are the best
candidates for potential deferral are indicated in the table and discussion
below.</p>
<p>The CCIT reviewed the prioritization, distributed it to the Leadership Team,
and discussed the prioritization during a videoconference held October 13,
2009. Improvements identified during the videoconference were incorporated
into the document, which was then distributed at the DataONE kickoff meeting
held October 20-22, 2009.</p>

<h3>Use Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Authentication Using Short-term Solution</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/12_uc.html"><em>Use Case 12</em></a> - User Authentication: Person, via client software, authenticates
against Identify Provider to establish session token. Many operations in the
DataONE system require user authentication to ensure that the user&#8217;s identity
is known to the system, and that appropriate access controls can be executed
based on the identity.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/14_uc.html"><em>Use Case 14</em></a> - System Authentication and Authorization: System
Authentication/Authorization - Server authenticates and performs system
operations (e.g. replication). This use case represents node-to-node
authentication.</p>
<p>Search and Retrieval, Indexing, Read Data and Metadata, Metadata
Interoperability</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/01_uc.html"><em>Use Case 1</em></a> - CRUD Read(): Get object identified by GUID (authenticated or not,
notify subscriber of access). A client has an identifier for some object
within the DataONE system and is retrieving the referenced object. The DataONE
system must resolve the identifier and return the object bytes after checking
that the user has read privileges on the object.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/02_uc.html"><em>Use Case 02</em></a> - List GUIDs By Search: Get list of GUIDs from metadata search
(anonymous and authenticated). A user performs a search against the DataONE
system and receives a list of object identifiers (GUIDs) that match the search
criteria. The list of GUIDs is filtered such that only objects for which the
user has read permission will be returned. This use case assumes that the
search is being performed by submitting a query against a CN.</p>
<p>Replication of Data and Metadata</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/06_uc.html"><em>Use Case 06</em></a> - MN Synchronize: Replicate / synchronize metadata record between
Member Node and Coordinating Node. As data packages, or portions thereof, are
created or modified, the metadata associated with those needs to be replicated
to the coordinating nodes. The presence of new or changed information on a
Member Node (MN) is made known to a Coordinating Node (CN) through the status
information in a ping() response. If so indicated, the CN schedules a
synchronization operation with the MN, a list of changed object GUIDS is
retrieved by the CN, and the CN proceeds to retrieve and process each object
identified. If new data packages are present on the MN, then a MN-MN
synchronization process is scheduled.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/09_uc.html"><em>Use Case 09</em></a> - Replicate MN to MN: Replicate data from Member Node to Member
Node - (facilitated by Coordinating Node or independently but notifying
Coordinating Node of operation).</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/24_uc.html"><em>Use Case 24</em></a> - MNs and CNs Support Transactions: Transactions - CNs and MNs
should support transaction sets where operations all complete successfully or
get rolled back (e.g., upload both data and metadata records). Implementation
of this use case could be deferred to year 2.</p>
<p>Basic Heartbeat / Health Monitoring (candidate for deferral to year 2)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/10_uc.html"><em>Use Case 10</em></a> - MN Status Reports: Coordinating Node checks &#8220;liveness&#8221; of all
Member Nodes. Implementation of this use case could be deferred to year 2.</p>
<p>Basic Logging Infrastructure (candidate for deferral to year 2)</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/16_uc.html"><em>Use Case 16</em></a> - Log CRUD Operations: All CRUD operations on metadata and data
are logged at each node. Implementation of this use case could be deferred to
year 2.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/17_uc.html"><em>Use Case 17</em></a> - CRUD Logs Aggregated at CNs: All CRUD logs are aggregated at
coordinating nodes. Implementation of this use case could be deferred to year
2.</p>
<p>Basic Member Node Registry Services</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="UseCases/03_uc.html"><em>Use Case 03</em></a> - Register MN: Register a new Member Node. This use case describes
the technical process for addition of a new member node (MN) to the DataONE
infrastructure. It is assumed that the appropriate social contracts have been
formed and the MN is operational, ready to be connected.</p>

<h2>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Prioritizing system implementation to address the use cases involves several
factors including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Vision of the project</em>. The system is being designed with some overall goals
described by the vision of the project proposal.</li>
<li><em>Requirements of the community</em>. The stakeholders that comprise the user and
participant community quite likely has some opinion on functionalities of
the system that are important to them. If these are not properly addressed,
then the resulting system may appear as a failure to them.</li>
<li><em>Requirements of the sponsor</em>. The sponsor has laid out goals in the RFP that
the project is responding to and also in the final agreement for conducting the work.</li>
<li><em>Dependencies between use cases</em>. Implementation of functionality to address
some use cases will require implementation of some components not directly
specific in a use case.</li>
<li><em>Resources available for implementation</em>. Some use cases may be identified as
high priority, but would require resources that would prevent implementation
of a number of other lower priority features.</li>
