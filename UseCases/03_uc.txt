Notes
~~~~~

- Specify default replication policies

- Also check for version updates

- Should new nodes be registered with specified trust levels?

- Data providers that use acceptable services can still be discovered and
  accessed without registering in the DataONE registry ( Conflicting, as
  someone has to register it)

- Allow service providers to register their services, (such as data extraction
  services) (ala GEOSS), but include mapping to higher semantic model

- For well known services, registration system must be able to describe
  constraints (e.g., allowable inputs, outputs, algorithms that can be
  specified)

- Services can be parameterized

- Member node should be able to request the coordinating node to re-validate
  its capabilities list.

- Are there different levels of trust for member nodes?
