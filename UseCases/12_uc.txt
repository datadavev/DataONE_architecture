Notes
~~~~~

- To be a bit more abstract, it might be good to use something like
  login(user, credentials) or login(subject) for the method signature. Here
  "subject" would be similar to the `javax.security.auth.Subject
  <http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/security/auth/Subject.html>`_
  concept. (PEA)

- Can logins also happening against a MN, which simply proxies the request up
  to the CN? (PEA)
