Notes
~~~~~

- This diagram should include a step for email confirmation.

- By default, accounts have no real privileges. To get higher privileges,
  users may have to jump through more hoops (such as verifying their
  association with a project/institution)

- Presumably, if we are using external identity providers this user account
  management functionality isn't provided by the CN. Right? (PEA)
