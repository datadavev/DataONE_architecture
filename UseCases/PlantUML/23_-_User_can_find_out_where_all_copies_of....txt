title Interactions 23 - User can find out where all copies of my data are \nin the system and can expunge them 
actor "User (Data Owner)" as user
participant "Client" as app_client << Application >>

c_query -> c_authorize: isAuth (token, resultset)
participant "Verify API" as c_ver << Coordinating Node >>
c_authorize -> c_ver: isValidToken (token)
c_ver -> c_authorize: T or F
c_authorize -> c_query: T or F
c_query -> app_client: records or fail
participant "CRUD API" as c_crud << Coordinating Node >>
app_client -> c_crud: deleteRecords (token, listOfGUIDs)
c_crud -> app_client: ack or fail
note right
Can the Query API find out where all
copies of my data are in the system
or should this be handled by another
API?
end note
