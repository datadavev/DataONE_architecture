participant "CRUD API" as m_crud << Member Node >>
participant "Query API" as c_query << Coordinating Node >>
c_query -> m_crud: getLogRecords (nodeID, fromDate, toDate)
note right
Assume Member Node has authority for
accessing Coordinating Node log records.
end note
m_crud -> c_query: records or fail
note right
Can the Query API handle queries
on log records or should this be
handled by another API?
(e.g. "Report API"?)
end note
