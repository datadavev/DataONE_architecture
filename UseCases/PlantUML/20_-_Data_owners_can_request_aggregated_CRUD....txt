title Interactions 20 - Data owners can request aggregated CRUD log for \n{time, period, object id} for all of 'their' objects 
actor "User (Data Owner)" as user
participant "Client" as app_client << Application >>
user -> app_client
participant "Authentication API" as c_authenticate << Coordinating Node >>
app_client -> c_authenticate: login (user, pw)
c_authenticate -> app_client: token or failure
participant "Query API" as c_query << Coordinating Node >>
app_client -> c_query: getLogRecords (GUID, fromDate, toDate)
participant "Authorization API" as c_authorize << Coordinating Node >>
c_query -> c_authorize: isAuth (token, resultset)
participant "Verify API" as c_ver << Coordinating Node >>
c_authorize -> c_ver: isValidToken (token)
c_ver -> c_authorize: T or F
c_authorize -> c_query: T or F
c_query -> app_client: records or fail
note right
Can the Query API handle queries
on log records or should this be
handled by another API?
(e.g. "Report API"?)
end note
