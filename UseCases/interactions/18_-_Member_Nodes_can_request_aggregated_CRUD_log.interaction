title 18 - Member Nodes can request aggregated CRUD log for {time period, object
id, user id} for all of 'their' objects

c_query -> m_crud: getLogRecords (nodeID, fromDate, toDate)
note right
Assume Member Node has authority for
accessing Coordinating Node log records.
end note
c_query <-- m_crud: records or fail
note right
Can the Query API handle queries
on log records or should this be
handled by another API?
(e.g. "Report API"?)
end note
