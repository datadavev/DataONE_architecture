Notes
~~~~~

- I don't understand Step #7. To me the serviceRequest in step #3 is the
  actual request for MN-B to do a "system operation", which kicks off the
  verification steps #4 and #5. If this example service request is
  replication, then step #3 should point to the replication API, and
  internally MN-B decides that it must perform the verify step #4. Then step
  #6 is the response to the system operation, and step #7 is not needed. (I
  think that this diagram must be showing a kind of pre-approval process for
  the operation in step #7, but it doesn't make sense to me because in step
  #7, MN-B will just have to re-verify the token again.) (PEA)
