Notes
~~~~~

- Are IDs are pegged to versions? If so, update might differ more radically
  from create.

- If delete is a metadata operation only, then will be very similar to update.
  But if it is a physical operation, it becomes more complex. Will there be an
  archival copy? Will member nodes that hold replicas be "forced" to destroy
  the replicas?

- Is submit from a member node a push or pull?

- Should queuing of a submission within a member node be required for success?
  (We assume yes, to guarantee replication of submissions).
