  - 20090114 (TWG meeting).  Subsequent various modifications.

Version 
  Draft

Goal
  Get object identified by GUID (authenticated or not, notify subscriber of access).

Summary 

  A client has an identifier for some object within the DataONE system and is
  retrieving the referenced object. The DataONE system must resolve the
  identifier and return the object bytes after checking that the user has read
  privileges on the object.  

  Watchers (subscribers) of the object are notified of the retrieval (what are
  they notified of?).

Actors
  - Client requesting object
  - Coordinating Node
  - Member Node

Preconditions 
  - Client has authenticated to at the desired level (e.g. client
    may not have authenticated, so access might be anonymous).

Triggers
  - Watchers are notified of the retrieval
  - Operation is logged (are loggers a type of watcher?)

Post Conditions
  - The client has a copy of the object bytes (or an error message in the case
    of failure)
  - The log is updated with the results of the operation
  - Watchers perform their processing


Notes
~~~~~

- for the GET operation, the coordinating node does not need to check access,
  because the member node will do this check before delivering the results.
- Data sent to watchers might include: timestamp, object identifier, user id,
  IP of client,
